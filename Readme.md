    How youâ€™re representing objects in your system? Tell us about the data structure
    - Not representing any of the drawn objects, this is a stateless drawing board.

    How the undo-redo functionality is working? Discuss the approach here.
    - The functions work as follows: - A history array is initialized with no elements along with a pointer (p) initialized as -1. - Whenever a change is made to the state of the canvas, an image is saved in the history array with the state after the change, and p is incremented. - If undo is requested, we subtract p by 1, clear the canvas, and draw the pth state from the history array. - If redo is requested, we add 1 to p, clear the canvas, and draw the pth state from the history array.
